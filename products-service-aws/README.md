### Project structure

The project code base is mainly located within the `src` folder. This folder is divided in:

- `functions` - containing code base and configuration for your lambda functions
- `libs` - containing shared code base between your lambdas
- `mocks` - containing mocks for products endpoints

### Endpoints

- `products` - https://3ki6jep1cg.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/products
- `products/{id}` - https://3ki6jep1cg.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/products/{id}
